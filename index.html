    <h3>About Me</h3>
    <p>I’m interested in becoming a Software Engineer that makes real impact in the world! Specifically I 
        would love to create applications that smooth the process of communication and language between people, 
        as language is the single most important ability that human beings have. It’s how we collaborate, how we 
        learn, and how we appreciate one another most in the most fundamental way.
